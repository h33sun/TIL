## how git works

### Workspace, Index, Local Repository, Remote Repository

1. Workspace

Workspace is my computer.

First, make a project folder you want to work with.
If any changes happen : you add them to Index using `git add`

2. Index

Index is a stage.
with `git add` you can add tracked files to the stage.

3. Local Repository

With `git commit` you write leave a msg about commit.

4. Remote repository

With `git push` you push your commits to your github repository.
